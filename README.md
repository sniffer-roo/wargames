# Wargames

 I have moved to the world of wargames recently; moved mostly by curiosity and a random class on university
	The challenge they offer is kind of cool, and the discovery paths they unlock are not always clear
		Blogs are not really my cup of tea, so I think that making a huge list in a repo might do
			Always, keeping in mind that the me that started is the one reading the hints
				And trying not to reveal the actual solution in full, to help the rest


### Guidelines
 Inside each folder, I will list each level as a separate file, with hints inside them; what is used, 
and maybe how it is. Also if there is something that is a good addition to what is needed, or other 
ways to get to the solution, they are all welcome and wanted for them.
 If there is something I can also make in code, I will gladly label the file with the level name 
and put it in the folders. I am also pretty new to programming so it might not be the most efficient
way to solve it, but it gives a hint about it. Even though, I recommend the completition of the level
before using them, or at least be completely sure that you understand what is going on before peeking.
